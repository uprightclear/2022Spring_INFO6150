            <h2>News@Northeastern</h2>
            <p>Boston is full of art—as long as you know where to look. This month, we’ll introduce you to the hidden gems of the city’s public art scene, as well as the artists whose work enlivens buildings, tunnels, and academic campuses throughout Boston’s neighborhoods. Take a virtual tour of some of Boston’s finest displays by Black artists before heading out on foot, camera in hand.</p>
            <p>We’ll start at Northeastern’s Boston campus, where aerosol artist Cedric Douglas painted the mural A World Of Innocent Discovery on the side of Behrakis Health Sciences Center at 30 Leon St. The piece—part of the public art initiative of Joseph E. Aoun, president of Northeastern—is meant to encourage imagination in young people. Douglas is also the artist behind a nearby mural on the exterior wall of the former Punter’s Pub. </p>
            <p>Douglas served as an artist-in-residence with Northeastern’s Center for the Arts in the fall of 2015 and he created the mural the following spring.</p>
            <p>The roaring energy and hard-charging spirit of the Huskies’ most devoted—and loudest—ice hockey fans will return to TD Garden Monday night as the men’s team takes the ice aiming for their consecutive fourth Beanpot victory.

                Unwitting spectators, you have been warned.

                “For those experiencing it for the first time, especially at a Beanpot game, when you hear that crowd, it is just a wave of sound. It’s nuts,” says Ethan Fasking, a fifth-year computer science and physics major who’s helped run the DogHouse for the past several years. “It’s an incredible feeling.”

                Amid the chaos of COVID-19-based cancellations and crowd restrictions, Northeastern’s dedicated fans and pep-band members remained committed to connecting and engaging students, upping their social-media outreach and doubling down at games where the crowd and the team needed an enthusiastic pick-me-up.
            </p>
            <p>The NU Pep Band’s most powerful and infectious weapon is “Stacy’s Mom,” a Fountains of Wayne song that’s become the team’s de-facto anthem.

                “My very first Beanpot when we played ‘Stacy’s Mom’ and the crowd all started singing, it was so surreal. I’ve never experienced something like that,” says JoJo Brennan, who’s played the flute with the NU Pep Band since she started at the university five years ago.

                “It’s one of my favorite parts of a game. Often the crowd has been asking for ‘Stacy’s Mom’ for the whole whole game, and when we finally play it everyone just erupts into song. It’s wonderful,” says Brennan, a fifth-year communications major.

                Don’t be fooled by the smiles and raucous cheering, however. Both the DogHouse and the NU Pep Band take their jobs seriously. That includes at least a few hours a week preparing the team’s banner, making supportive signs for the home team (and less supportive ones for their opponents), and, for members of the band, working out logistics to ensure the 40-plus players and their instruments are delivered to the right place.
